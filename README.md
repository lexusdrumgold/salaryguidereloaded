# :moneybag: Salary Guide Reloaded

Every year, The Diamondback publishes Salary Guide, which contains the salaries
of University employees in an easily digestible format. The [current
template](http://salaryguide.diamondbacklab.com) was created in 2017
([@lexusdrumgold](https://github.com/lexusdrumgold)), and was also reused for
the 2018 edition of Salary Guide.

This year, our goal is to revamp the design and features of the site, most notably
adding a filter option to the site that'll allow the user to view previous
salary data without navigating to a different site.

## Getting Started

At The Diamondback, we’ve pledged to hold the University of Maryland accountable
in our coverage. Our annual salary guide adheres to that mission, laying out
each university employee’s yearly pay in an easily digestible format. Here, you
can find information searchable by salary, department, title and other items.  

Each year, the university provides this public data to The Diamondback in a
basic Excel spreadsheet. We’ve rendered its contents online without tampering;
if so inclined, readers could request the same public data from the university
to receive all of the information presented in this guide.  

The Diamondback chooses to compile this data each year as a service to our
readers — giving students, alumni, employees and others in the university
community immediate, comprehensive access. As with all of our news coverage, the
salary guide maintains our commitment to objectivity. We won’t tell you what
conclusions to draw from these numbers, but it’s our hope that they’ll give you
the information you need to reflect on your own. As always, your takeaways from
this information are your own — just as they should be.
