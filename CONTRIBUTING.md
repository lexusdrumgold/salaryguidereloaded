## Testing

When you're ready to test your changes, you have two options:

1. Run `npm test` in your project directory. This run your tests, as well as all
  the tests in the tests in the `tests` directory.

2. Run `jest tests/<PATH_TO_YOUR_TEST>`. This will run your test file alone.

## Making a Pull Request

**Note: Before creating a new branch and creating a pull request for your
changes, your build must pass all the tests and must work locally with the
Firebase staging instance. If you need help, please create a
test file and leave a comment in the test body, making note of any issues in
their respective files. Make sure to label your pull request "help wanted."**

If you're ready to have your changes reviewed, make sure your code is well
documented, and create a branch for your changes. Make sure to name the branch
appropriately, prefixing it with `feature-`, `issue-`, `hotfix-`, or `release-`. To
do this, run the following in your terminal:  

1. `git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>`
2. `git commit -am "<DESCRIPTIVE_COMMIT_MESSAGE>"`
3. `git push`

If you need to make additional changes, checkout your branch again, and then
commit and push your changes.
